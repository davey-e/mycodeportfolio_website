    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <img src="./images/me.jpg" height="150">

    <p>My name is Dave Ellis. I live in Aberdeen and I'm currently un-employed :( *</p>
    <p>I graduated from the Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen in 1996 with a BSc in Electronic and Electrical Engineering.
    Since graduating I've spent the last 20 years of my career working in the oil industry, starting off as a field engineer
  working offshore installing electronic equipment inside wells (yes, that sounds tricky but it is possible, but too complicated to explain here!)
and then working my way through other similar postions, but becoming more involved in data acquisition systems and data communications and working offshore less.</p>
  <p>The last 10 years of my career I've been working in a software development team where I tested, deployed and configured the software,
    managed test environments and databases and provided support to customers.</p>
    <p>I really enjoyed working in a software team in a testing capacity, but since being made redundant I've realised that
    there is much more demand for software developers than there is for testers, so I made the decision shortly after being made redundant
  to look into courses that I could do to become a developer. I very quickly found CodeClan and realised that this was the perfect course for me
    and so I applied and was fortunate enough to be accepted onto a course very quickly.</p>
    <p>I am very excited to be able to shift my career from testing other people's software to creating my own!</p>
    <p class="special">* The sad face is for being un-employed, not for living in Aberdeen! </p>
