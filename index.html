    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Hi, my name is Dave Ellis.</p>
    <p>I am currently a student on the <a href="http://codeclan.com" target="_blank">CodeClan</a> 16 week software developement course
      in Edinburgh.<br>
      <br>
      I am currently on week 5 of the course. This week is our first project week! I will be working on an individual project
      which will consolidate all of my knowledge from the first 4 weeks of the course<br>
      <br>

      <p>During the course I will be completing 4 different projects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The first project will be an individual project,
  which will completed on week 5 and will demonstrate my knowledge of Ruby, SQL and HTML/CSS</li>
  <li>The second project will also be an individual project,
  which will be completed on week 9 and will demonstrate my Java knowledge</li>
  <li>The third project will be a group project, which will be completed on week 14
  and will demonstrate my Javascript knowledge</li>
  <li>The final project will be an individual project again, which will be completed on week 16
  and will consolidate the knowledge that I have gained from the whole course</li>
</ul>
<br>

<p>As I complete each project I will be adding details of the projects and how I tackled them and hopefully
  including final versions of the working projects on this website.</p>
<br>
