      <h3>The Project Week</h3>
      <p>On Thursday 14th December we were given the 4 different projects that we could choose from along with the brief for each project.</p>
      <p>The projects that we could choose from were as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>MoneyCashboard</li>
        <li>Animal Shelter</li>
        <li>Keith's Record Store</li>
        <li>Burger Tracker</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I choose to take on the MoneyCashboard as my project. As a summary of what was expected from this project, we were to create a web based application that would allow
      users to track and budget their spending.</p>
        <p>The full brief for this can be found in my documentation for the project here: <a href="https://github.com/davey-e/project1_week5_money_cashboard_documents/blob/master/Project_brief.md" target="_blank"  title="Project Brief - Opens in a new tab">Project Brief</a> </p>
      <p>We started working on planning for our projects on Friday 15th December, initially gathering together with fellow students whom were taking on the same project
      and then breaking out to continue with planning individually.</p>
      <p>I spent all of Friday and some time on Saturday going through the files, database tables, classes, models, views and controllers that I would need to include in order to achieve the MVP of the project.
      I also started thinking about any code that I would need to add in order to achieve some of the extensions that I wanted to add to my project.</p>
      <p>I started working on the code on Saturday and continued working on it throughout the rest of the week at CodeClan. All of the students also worked on their projects at the CodeClan premises and this provided a great environment for us to all work
      our projects individually but also helping eachother out as much as possible.</p>
      <p>I had completed all of the coding for the MVP by Wednesday morning and then worked on some extensions for the rest of the day. There were a lot of other extensions that I could have added to my app, but I wanted to make sure that the features that
        I had added to my app were as solid as possible, so I spent some time testing, bug fixing and refactoring on Thursday morning. I then worked on my presentation for presenting my work.</p>
      <p>On Friday 22nd December we all gathered with the instructors to each present our applications and give some details of how we approached the project. We were each given 10 minutes to present and 5 minutes of question time, so with 20 students, this took up the whole day.
        It was great to see the amazing apps that everyone had produced and to see the different approaches everyone had taken, even for the same projects.</p>
